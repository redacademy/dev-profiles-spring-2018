                <h1>Life Before RED</h1>
                <h3>Hometown: Sarnia, Ontario</h3>
                <p>Before coming to British Columbia, I was living in South-Western Ontario, where I've held many jobs having many different titles. My hometown being a mecca for the trades, it was only natural for me to end up in the mix. 
                    My jobs have varied from line-worker in an automotive rim factory, to landscaper, to joining the Boilermakers Union. In 2010, I earned my AZ (class 1) license and became a tractor trailer driver, working my way up from construction, to heavy-haul liquid tanker. 
                    I worked my way to the top of my field before taking on my newest adventure, here in BC at RED Academy!

                <h1>Future Endeavours After RED</h1>
                <p>After graduating from RED, I plan on finding employment wherever I can, ideally within a company specializing in a field that matches personal interests. 
                    It's a brave new world out there as a web development student, and I intend on experiencing as much of it as I can

                <h1>Hidden Talent</h1>
                <p>One of my talents that most would not know just by looking at me, is that I am quite mechanically inclined. I love cars. 
                    I love working on, driving, and generally anything to do with them. I enjoy diagnosing a problem, and getting my hands greasy trying to fix it.
                    My hope is that my affinity for finding, building and solving will cross over to the web development world, crossing over from the physical to the digital.
