          <h2 class="past">Past Me</h2>
          <p>I did my growing up in Lethbridge, Alberta. 
          It's a dumb place; I'm not sure why people live there.<br/><br/>
          I came out to Vancouver to escape a few years back. Far preferable. 9/10.</p>
          <h2 class="current">Current Me</h2>
          <p>Now I'm doing coding apparently. <br/><br/>
          Just quit my job as a manager at a Toys R Us (obvious reasons) and assume 
          I'll be spending most of my time now coding, gaming, and watching movies.<br/>
          <br/>Sounds good to me.<br/><br/>I've spent the last week in Costa Rica so getting 
          this all done today was very stressful.<br/>
          <br/><em>Does knowing way too much about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8">Marvel movies</a> count
          as a secret talent?</em><br/><br/>
          Things I like
          <ul>
            <li>Community (the tv show not actual people)</li>
            <li>Tom Collins'</li>
            <li>Remembering I needed a list in here last minute</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h2 class="future">Future Me</h2>
          <p>I guess that really depends on how all this goes, right?</p>
