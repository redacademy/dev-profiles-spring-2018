            <p>
                In December 1991, I was born in beautiful Richmond, BC, to immigrant parents.  I was raised in Richmond and have lived there for most of my life. 
                People will often ask me if I speak Chinese and the answer to that is effectively 'No'.  I understand <em>maaaaybe</em> a little bit.
                  My dad speaks French and my mom speaks Chinese.  The only
                common language we use at home is English.  Here's a picture of me with my dog, Cola.

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius" target="_blank"><img src="./images/mauritius.jpg" alt="A beach in Mauritius"></a>
            The best vacation I have ever had is hands-down visiting my dad's home country of Mauritius.  It's this tiny island
            on the south east coast of Africa.  The island is surrounded by a coral reef so you can walk out 100m from the beach
            and still be waist deep in clear water.  It was the first time my dad had been back since he immigrated to Canada
            and people from his village still remembered who he was.  It was amazing to me how different island-living is from the hustle and bustle
            of the city.  Click the picture for additional information about Mauritius!

            <summary><h2>2010.</h2><h3>my secret talent</h3> </summary>  
                <p>My first retail job was at Aeropostale.  I worked there for 3 years part-time while I studied in university and it is in this store that I developed
                    my secret talent: folding laundry.  I can fold XS-XXL shirts all to the same size in one stack. Very. Quickly.</p>

                <summary><h2>2016.</h2><h3>before RED</h3></summary>
                <p>In 2016, I came home from Calgary and passed the nursing license exam to become a registered nurse.  Shortly afterward, I got hired into Fraser Health 
                    and have worked with them since then at the Surrey Memorial Hospital.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy training Brazilian jiu-jitsu at <a href="https://www.pttrichmond.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Top Team</a> in Richmond.  I'm at the gym a couple times a week and have collected 4 stripes on my white belt since I started.</p>

                <p>In April, I will be starting the fullstack development program with RED Academy.
                    I'm looking forward to gaining the skill set to create applications that can improve and promote
                    healthy living through everyday technology.
