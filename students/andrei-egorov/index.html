        I grew up in the city of Karabalta in Kyrgyzstan. If you are not sure where this country is, you probably know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH2CABcffAo"> Borat.   </a>

        Not too long ago I lived in USA temporarely working for an IT services company in Chicago. 
        I initially wanted to become a professional accountant until I decided to become a web developer. 
        So, I had come to Vancouver and found a survival job as an accounting clerk, which I quit last Friday. I SURVIVED!

        While in the USA, I have visited a number of states and its most prominent landmarks such as: Zion Park, Mount Rush Moore, Crazy Horse, Grand Canyon and others.
        All of those places are what you would normally see on TV, but being there, especially Grand Canyon, makes you really understand how majecstic those places are. 
        It's hard to pick only one "best travel experience", so I will stick with the few mentioned above.

            I enjoy bike riding and hiking. I don't like sharing my secrets, so I will only tell you what my secret talent is if you promise not 
            to tell anyone. Click "I Promise, if you do".

        <div>
            
            I Promise: <input type="checkbox" id="promise" onclick="mytalent()">

            <script>
                function mytalent(){
                    var checkbox = document.getElementById("promise");
                    var text = document.getElementById("text");
                    if (checkbox.checked == true) {text.style.display = "block";}
                    else{
                        text.style.display = "none";
                    }

                }
